# GetQuorum Design Assessment

Congratulations!

If you've made it this far then you've been identified as an awesome GetQuorum Candidate. The next step is for you to complete an assessment of your design skills. The challenges are intended to take anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour depending on how in-depth you want to go. It's meant to spur discussion during your interview with us and it's an opportunity for you to assess how we collaborate as a team. 

## Instructions

Go to the folders for each assessment, the README there will provide instructions.
