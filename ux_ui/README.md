# GetQuorum UX/UI Design Challenge

This is a simple UX/UI Design Challenge.

## Instructions

1. Go to the `user_story.md` file and analyze the user story there.
2. Design a series of mockups or wireframes of an app that solves the user's pain point.

## Guidelines

- We're looking for a series of 3 to 5 wireframes (or slightly more if you feel it's needed)
- It doesn't have to be a full-fledged pixel perfect Figma prototype, some hand-drawn wireframes (or some Powerpoint slides) is good enough
- We're just looking to see how you think and spur discussions during our interview
- With that said, if you want to use Figma or XD or some other prototyping app, please feel free to do so.
- But please, don't spend an entire day or evening doing this...


## Submitting your assessment

Please submit your wireframes to Jerome by email, he would've emailed you the link to the assessments
