# The Hypothetical Pet Sitter App

## Story

As an owner of two cats and one dog, I occassionally have to travel out of town for a day or two. Whenever a new pet sitter cares for my pets, it would be great if I could easily share the care instructions with them.

## Things that we're looking

- A simple mobile or web responsive app
- An editable profile for each pet
- Care / feeding instructions for each pet
- Possible medical conditions for each pet, and what to watch out for
- Emergency contact numbers
- A way to easily share everything with a new pet sitter


## Considerations

- Simplicity is key, I or my pet sitter may only be minimally tech savvy
- Just focus on the pet profile and sharing info with the sitter, it's not a full fledge marketplace / Uber app or anything like that
